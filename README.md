# About Project
This is a [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK) challenge i tried my coding fingers on using

## Languages and Tools
- HTML
- SASS (CSS preprocessor)

## Methodologies
- BEM (Block Element Modifier)
- 7-1 Style Architecture 

## Codebase Documentation
You can navigate to sections of code by using CSS comments in source code.
Comments in css source code are in the form [folder/file] e.g [components/card] meaning the code is in the card sass partials (_card.scss) located in the components folder (in styles/sass folder). 

**N.B:** only vital snippet have comments in thier css rule set.

This project was implemented using the 7-1 style architecture. Sections of this project were disintegrated into the following sass folders

1. abstracts
    - [breakpoints](styles/sass/abstracts/_breakpoints.scss)
    - [colors](styles/sass/abstracts/_colors.scss)
    - [functions](styles/sass/abstracts/_functions.scss)
    - [mixins](styles/sass/abstracts/_mixins.scss)

2. base
    - [resets](styles/sass/base/_resets.scss)
    - [typography](styles/sass/base/_typography.scss)

3. components
    - [card](styles/sass/components/_card.scss)

4. layouts
    - [footer](styles/sass/layouts/_footer.scss)
    - [header](styles/sass/layouts/_header.scss)
    - [main](styles/sass/layouts/_main.scss)

5. pages
    - [home](styles/sass/pages/_home.scss)

This project and it documentation is subject to change in the future. Feel free to learn from it and use it in your projects.
